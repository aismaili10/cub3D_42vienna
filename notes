# NOTES

## GRAPHICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### RAYCASTING
[] issue when moving perpendicular to the side, side wall not shownwhen too close to side wall
	--> after the collision, somehow the raycaster miscalculates the drawEnd, some big negative number
[] remove all ft_strlen() from loops, for efficiancy, see big2.cub


### KEY HANDLING

[x] multiple key press
[] zoom


#### ROTATION



#### MOVEMENT



#### MINIMAP
[] big maps
[] small maps
[] maybe arrow

#### TEXTURE




## MAP VALIDITY

### TODO

[] Establish a cleaning strategy
[] Fix inverted textures
[] Restrict the movement too close to walls
[x] Put back ceiling and floor colors in render_background
[x] A Dublicate as last element before the map --> must handle at map read section
[x] lines with only spaces before main map
[] must check for valid path for the texture --> if open/execution fails
[x] checks for color assigning
	[x] overflow
	[x] in the correct range 0 - 255
	[x] plus minus sign
	[x] characters other then numeric and comma in SPECIFIER

#### anything regarding 2D map
[x] map postfix check; careful about "" as map or just ".cub"
[x] reading
[x] no newlines/empty lines in between actual map
[x] only 1 and 0 and Player Position
[x] Player Position only one
[x] spaces inside the map (within walls) are not valid
[x] spaces outside the map (outside walls) are valid
[x] accept newlines/empty lines only at the begin and end of actual map
[x] remove upper and lower empty lines (contenting only spaces or nothing)
	---> use substring after having read and joined into one line
[x] empty lines in between elements means not even spaces
[ ] better map messages

[] test extremely small maps
[] test extremely big maps

- libft
	[] ft_split_md() - norminette
	// we won't use this function, because we don't accept tabs

### DONE

[x] Dublicates of Textures
[x] Dublicates of Colors
[x] whitespace before identifier
[x] whitespace after specifier
[x] line with more than the identifier and specifier
[x] line with less than the identifier and specifier

### UNSURE

[x] file name/type checks
[x] path checks
