# NOTES

==> in branch ali_wall_col_adj: implemented the minimap
==> this branch is not yet merged with the main

## GRAPHICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### RAYCASTING
[] issue when moving perpendicular to the side, side wall not shownwhen too close to side wall
	--> after the collision, somehow the raycaster miscalculates the drawEnd, some big negative number
[] remove all ft_strlen() from loops, for efficiancy, see big2.cub
[] change variable name to all lowercase and shorter names

[x] Restrict the movement, now too close to walls

### KEY HANDLING

[x] multiple key press
[] zoom


#### ROTATION



#### MOVEMENT



#### MINIMAP
[] big maps
[] small maps
[] maybe arrow

#### TEXTURE




## MAP VALIDITY

### TODO

[] shorten MACRO NAME for colors like Abe
[] should we accept space before and after element??
[] Establish a cleaning strategy
[] Fix inverted textures
[] Do not accept tabs anywhere in the configuration file
[x] Put back ceiling and floor colors in render_background
[x] A Dublicate as last element before the map --> must handle at map read section
[x] lines with only spaces before main map
[] must check for valid path for the texture --> if open/execution fails
[x] checks for color assigning
	[x] overflow
	[x] in the correct range 0 - 255
	[x] plus minus sign
	[x] characters other then numeric and comma in SPECIFIER

#### anything regarding 2D map
[] 
[]
[]
[x] map postfix check; careful about "" as map or just ".cub"
[x] reading
[x] no newlines/empty lines in between actual map
[x] only 1 and 0 and Player Position
[x] Player Position only one
[x] spaces inside the map (within walls) are not valid
[x] spaces outside the map (outside walls) are valid
[x] accept newlines/empty lines only at the begin and end of actual map
[x] remove upper and lower empty lines (contenting only spaces or nothing)
	---> use substring after having read and joined into one line
[x] empty lines in between elements means not even spaces
[ ] better map messages

[] test extremely small maps
[] test extremely big maps

- libft
	[] ft_split_md() - norminette
	// we won't use this function, because we don't accept tabs

### DONE

[x] Dublicates of Textures
[x] Dublicates of Colors
[x] whitespace before identifier
[x] whitespace after specifier
[x] line with more than the identifier and specifier
[x] line with less than the identifier and specifier

### UNSURE

[x] file name/type checks
[x] path checks

Marco:
TODO:

1) write error msg with Error\n and then the message
2) check for empty lines after the map (tgey "should not" be valid)
3) Validate xpm image size. they must be 64x64.
4) Validate for xpm extension
5) If the palyer is duplicated, remove "Walls Not Closed!"
